TODO WEBSITE

Key functionalities
- Keep track of my homework that needs done.

PLAN

Log in - I want there to be multiple users that can use the site.
Home page - Home page should basically just be basic info about the user, and the tasks that they have to do.


Things we'll need:
We'll need an app.py so we can deal with the log ins and verify the users and stuff.
Need html templates for the log in page, and the main page

the actual to do list:
        So if I am a new user, and I am going to college, I'm working, and I'm keeping track of weekly personal tasks I need to do.
        I want to be able to create to do lists for college, work, and personal.
        Basically want to give each thing a tag.
        And give the option to look at all tasks that you need, with dates and how many days left to complete.
        if it a weekly thing have it repeat, but have the most current one come up, not have an endless list of them
